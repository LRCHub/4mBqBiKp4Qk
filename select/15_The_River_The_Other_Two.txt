Brains should make you smarter
And maybe sometimes your life is harder
Than I know
Someone like you just can't be right
Why would you say those things tonight

How lonely can one life be
Do you still feel the same as me
How lonely can one life be
Oh who cares anyway

Let me take you up to the river
Let me wrap you inside a dream
Let me take you into the water
And show me the endless sea

You and me no longer
And maybe next time you'll think much harder
Than you know
Why don't you live your life
And on my own I'll be alright

Let me take you up to the river
Let me take you up to the river

(Let me take you) How lonely can one life be
(Up to the river) Do you still feel the same as me
(Repeat to fade)
