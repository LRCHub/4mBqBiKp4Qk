Late one night, the river so bright
I was bathing in the pale moonlight
Didn't see no one looking around
Pull that ribbon, let my ringlets down
We grew up down the way
Walked to school together every day
I was so tall 'til we were sixteen
In a year, he towered over me

Thought he was a friend indeed
But a woman can't trust trust a man in need
Down on the muddy banks where the roses grow
The river cries, ooh, oh, 'cause the river knows

He professed a love so fine
Said he wanted me to be his bride
His desire, I didn't return
In its place, he let resentment burn
He left home to live in the hills
Making moonshine in a silver still
Mama said, "Stay away from that shine"
I always did until that dark night

Thought he was a friend indeed
But a woman can't trust trust a man in need
Down on the muddy banks where the roses grow
The river cries, ooh, oh, 'cause the river knows

My best dress mangled and torn
Head's pounding in the early morn'
Look to my hands all covered in red
Dug a hole out in the wild rose bed
Washed the proof out of my hair
Crimson streaming down my skin so fair
Shimmering moon staring at me
Now my secret is hers to keep

Thought he was a friend indeed
But a woman can't trust trust a man in need
Down on the muddy banks where the roses grow
The river cries, ooh, oh, 'cause the river knows

Late one night, the river so bright
I was bathing in the pale moonlight
Didn't see no one looking around
Pull that ribbon, let my ringlets down
