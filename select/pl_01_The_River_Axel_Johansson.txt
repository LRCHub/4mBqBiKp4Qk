You can kill the lights
you can draw the blinds
my heart's shackled down
bound to your bed
Can you stay a while?
keep me by your side
feel my scattered heart
fix me I said
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
We could go home
down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
down below, low, low
Can we stay inside?
lay here by the fire
please dont let me go
say it ain't so
Leave me in the night
with no warning sign
are we burning out?
mirrors and smoke?
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
We could go home
down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
down below, low, low
We could lay here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
We could sleep here
underneath the river
if you stay
if you stay
we could go home
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low
