Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride, yeah

She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river, dead, shot her dead

You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today, yeah

She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away, yeah

Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river, dead, dead
Shot her dead, shot her dead

Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away, yeah

Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river

Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river

Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river
