Down by the river where the water ends
Through the garden and over that broken fence
That tore your teenage dress apart
Ten years later the same goes for your heart
You stood there in a patch of falling sun
Through the dense tree crowns perhaps it was the only one
A soft hello where we used to meet
We walked and talked as the leaves crackled from our feet

By the grill in your hometown
Through the fields leading westbound
To the church where your parents met
A car passed by as you kissed me
You spoke of how you would miss me
Somehow without a trace of regret
You said "someday we'll look back on this and smile" I know I know I know
But it's going to be a while
But assuming there's no hell
I've got a bad feeling things will work out well
